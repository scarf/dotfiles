# dotfiles

dotfiles are my personal shell scripts

Right now all I have to share is my *.bash_prompt*

## .bash_prompt

This comment in the default `.bashrc` has always bothered me
> *uncomment for a colored prompt, if the terminal has the capability; turned*
> *off by default to not distract the user: the focus in a terminal window*
> *should be on the output of commands, not on the prompt*

Should it now?  Actually, even the most basic color helps me find where a command started, thus finding the output faster!  Silly hooman, I think you can take that comment and shove it! üòõ

This is my ridiculous and over-the-top, yet still beautiful, Bash shell prompt.  I started out with Kevin's *rainbow-bash-prompt*[^1] 'and kept "improving" it.  It's fully rainbow in 24-bit color, using jaseg's *lolcat*[^2], each prompt gradually moving across the color spectrum.  It features UTF-8 characters and emoji, because it's nearly 2023 so why not.  I'm from the 90's though, so had to throwback to some box drawing characters.  I'm actually surprised it hasn't turned into a hot mess; everything displays quite nicely in *Gnome Terminal*.  I added fallback options too for when not in a graphical environment.

The first line shows the exit status/code of the last command, date and time of completion of last command, current user, user's tty, short hostname, and the system's uptime.  It also features an eternal flame to make sure things keep running.  The second line shows the size of your command history, the command number for the current session, running jobs, sleeping jobs, current directory, and stats about the directory's contents: size of the data just in this directory (not including subdirectories), number of regular and hidden files, number of programs/executables, number of directories and hidden directories, number of links (visible plus hidden), and number of special files (block devices, character devices, pipes, and sockets)).  Finally, the third line is where you can actually enter your command!

![Main Example Screenshot](.bash_prompt-screenshots/ExampleMain.png?raw=true "Example screenshot of main interface")
![Fallback Example Screenshot](.bash_prompt-screenshots/ExampleFallback.png?raw=true "Example screenshot of fallback interface")

The most difficult part by far was figuring out how to pad the right ends of the first two lines so they remained connected, but I got it!  They will adapt to differing lengths of data displayed in the prompt as well as resizes of the terminal.  It's quite hacked together, with different snippets and ideas found over the Internet!  With the color/UTF-8 version, I had to manually offset the calculated padding for each line by a certain amount.  I think it has something to do with the Spiral Calendar (first on line 1) and Printer (last on line 2), since I had to add some spaces after those so the following text wasn't covered by the icon.  Either way, the implementation is quite consistent.  One problem I've seen so far is when the session command number increases from 9 to 10.  Another problem occurs if you descend into a directory with a really long name, forcing the second line to wrap.  Fortunately, these issues are quickly resolved by entering the next command or resizing your terminal (and entering the next command), respectively.

This's my first time sharing something on github, so I'll probably now want to add repository status & info to the prompt somehow...

Anyway, happy to hear about your suggestions and improvements!  Happy hacking üòÅ
